for next time:

click on marker for park info, using NPS API
change marker
instead of marker popup, load HTML to the right
look for a weather tile API and add it as well (maybe via toggle)

See if leaflet can load N data and set zoom to fit them all in
	fitbounds(P)

use a weather api specific for park, next 3 days
